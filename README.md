In this case pirates and invaders are state and state transitions.

The sidenotes documentation for talos can be found [here](https://captain-porcelain.github.io/talos/toc.html).

Talos is a small library that implements a finite state machine that can be used to manage the state
of an application and the transitions from one state to another.

A talos fsm is defined by a list of states and a map of transitions between them:

```clojure
(def states
  (list
    (talos/state :a)
    (talos/state :b)
    (talos/state :c state-callback)))

(def transitions
  (list
    (talos/transition :a-to-b :a :b)
    (talos/transition :b-to-c :b :c)
    (talos/transition :all-to-a :* :a)))

(def fsm (talos/fsm states transitions))
```

A state is identified by a keyword and may have an optional callback that is executed when the `fsm` enters that state.

Transitions are defined by an event like `:a-to-b` as well as the state in which the event is accepted and the state
that is to be entered next. The special state `:*` can be used to indicate that an event is accepted in any state.

A transition is triggered when the `fsm` processes an event which can have optional data associated.

```clojure
(talos/process! fsm {:event :a-to-b})

(talos/process! fsm {:event :a-to-b :something :value})
```

The event is handed to callback functions with the `fsm` itself:

```clojure
(defn state-callback
  [source-fsm source-event]
  (println (:something source-event)))
```

The `fsm` also wraps an atom that contains a map and which can be accessed like this:

```clojure
(talos/data! fsm #(assoc % :my-key :my-value))

(talos/data fsm :my-key)
```

Transitions additionally may have a condition function that is evaluated upon the event and the state progression is performed
only if the condition is evaluated as true:

```clojure
(def transitions
  (list
    (talos/transition :a-to-b :a :b (fn [event data] (= :value (:something event))))
    (talos/transition :a-to-b :a :c)))
```

The condition function is handed the event and the contents data atom of the fsm for the evaluation.
